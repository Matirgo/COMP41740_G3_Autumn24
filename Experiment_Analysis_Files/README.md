The current folder contains the experiment results .csv file, along with the statistical analysis file coded in R.
These two files are necessary in order to run the statistical analysis of this experiment.
The output of the R file is included in the two subfolders for summary statistics and images.
By running the R file, you should get the same outputs, albeit, without them being stored in designated folders as they are in this repository.
